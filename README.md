# ClockClock24

Project inspired from the [ClockClock project](https://clockclock.com/)

> ClockClock 24 is both a kinetic sculpture and a functioning clock. Its hands veer from unpredictable, mechanical spinning, to perfect, synchronised alignment; to visually represent the abstract concept of time, and to report real time.
